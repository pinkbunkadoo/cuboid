## What is it?

Cuboid is a brief interactive demo, inspired by 80s isometric puzzle games, like the ZX Spectrum's Head over Heels. It was created to test a toy software renderer I had written in JavaScript. The code is not optimised, so I apologise for crimes against your CPU.

For best performance I recommend using Google Chrome.
